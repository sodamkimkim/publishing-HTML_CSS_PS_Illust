        <h3>Aladdin OST</h3>

        <p>
            Here comes a wave<br>

            Meant to wash me away<br>

            A tide that is taking me under<br>

            swallowing sand<br>

            left with nothing to say<br>

            My voice drowned out in the thunder<br>

        </p>

        <P>
            But I won't cry<br>

            And I won't start to crumble<br>

            Whenever they try<br>

            To shut me or cut me down<br>
        </P>


        <P>
            I won't be silenced<br>

            You can't keep me quiet<br>

            Won't tremble when you try it<br>

            All I know is I won't go speechless<br>

            Cause I'll breathe<br>

            When they try to suffocate me<br>

            Don't you underestimate me<br>

            Cause I know that I won't go speechless<br>
        </P>

        <P>
            Written in stone<br>

            Every rule, every word<br>

            Centuries old and unbending<br>

            Stay in your place<br>

            Better seen and not heard<br>

            But now that story is ending<br>
        </P>

        <P>
            Cause I<br>

            I cannot start to crumble<br>

            So come on and try<br>

            Try to shut me and cut me down<br>

            I won't be silenced<br>

            You can't keep me quiet<br>

            Won't tremble when you try it<br>

            All I know is I won't go speechless<br>
        </P>

        <P>
            Speechless<br>

            Let the storm in<br>

            I cannot be broken<br>

            No, I won't live unspoken<br>

            Cause I know that I won't go speechless<br>
        </P>

        <P>
            Try to lock me in this cage<br>

            I won't just lay me down and die<br>

            I will take these broken wings<br>

            And watch me burn across the sky<br>

            Hear the echoes saying I...<br>

            Won't be silenced<br>

            Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it<br>

            All I know is I won't go speechless<br>

            Speechless<br>
        </P>

        <p>
            Cause I'll breathe<br>

            When they try to suffocate me<br>

            Don't you underestimate me<br>

            Cause I know that I won't go speechless<br>

            All I know is I won't go speechless<br>

            Speechless
        </P>
